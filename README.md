# Breathe

## Description
Mental health is an important part of everyone's life. More and more emphasis is being put into taking care of each individual's mental health, but it is still overlooked.  Breathe is meant to help alleviate some pressure and remind ourselves to take care. 

Once Breathe is running, it will send a reminder every hour and a half to take a break. Just simply press the button and a calming animation will display on your webpage. When you finish with your break, Simply click again to stop the animation and your break duration will be stored in a Mongo database. This information is stored so that you can check your daily progress and see just how much time you have allocated to your mental wellbeing in comparison to working hours.

Enjoy!
